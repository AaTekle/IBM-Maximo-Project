  <p>Our microphones have been able  to accurately capture and reproduce sound waves with a wide frequency response, high sensitivity, and a high signal-to-noise ratio.</p>

  <h2 id = "Our-Why">Our Why</h2>
  <p>We just felt as if it was necessary to go out and provide high quality microphones for those who are on a budget.</p>

  <h2 id = "Features">Features</h2>
  <p>Frequency response: A microphone with a wide frequency response is able to accurately capture a wide range of sounds, from low bass tones to high treble tones. This is important because it allows the microphone to accurately reproduce the full range of sounds in the source audio.</p>
